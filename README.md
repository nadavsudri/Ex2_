This is my solution to Ex2 from cs101 as represented in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-18T-dj00apE4k1qmpXGOaqttxLn-Kwi/edit
the solution is a digital spreadsheet capable of simple calculations such as [+,-,\,*]
the solution is based on formulas - ex: "=1+2*(3+4)" 
and also capable of milty cell calculations - ex: "= 2*A2-(4+A3)"
when an invalid data is enterd an error is shown:
1) invalid formula - ERR_Form
2) cerciular ref - ERR_cycle_form
feel free to test the limits of my solution.
